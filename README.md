# LeetCode Add-ons

Chrome extension to enhance LeetCode experience.

**Hide difficulty on question**
Difficulty & successful submissions are hidden on question page. Helps when a random question is selected and you don't want to know the difficulty.

**Random question from current visible questions**
LeetCode's native "Choose One" will pick from all questions. Extension adds a "Random Question" button that will pick a random question from the current list of questions.
